# Project description

The following project is an app to learn Spanish vocabulary. Each time exercise is different as words or definitions are chosen randomly.
The project has been made as part of final workshop during a bootcamp at Coders Lab.
The app hasn't been finished yet, I am still working on it :) 
I had to put 1 js file due to some temporary problems with Gulp.

Technologies I used:
HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, jQuery, Gulp, Firebase(to finish).
